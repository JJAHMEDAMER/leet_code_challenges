[Link On LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/partitioning-into-minimum-number-of-deci-binary-numbers/)

## Problem
Given two integers num1 and num2, return the sum of the two integers.

#### Example 1:
```python
Input: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
Output: 17
Explanation: num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.
```
#### Example 2:
```python
Input: num1 = -10, num2 = 4
Output: -6
Explanation: num1 + num2 = -6, so -6 is returned.
 ```

#### Constraints:

-100 <= num1, num2 <= 100
